##   General description:


The site is fully about me for recruitment purposes. Creates a kind of **extended CV**. The site was created in such a way as to show my programming skills **(I used all my skills and I tried to show what kind of person I am)**.


## Technologies used:

- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS
- BEM convention
- Normalize
- GIT


## Folders:

  The files include folders such as : **css, js, images** and **index.html**.

## CSS:

This folder is divided into **8 files** : **article.css, footer.css, form.css, header.css, navigation.css, section.css, style.css, table.css**. Each of them steels individual elements on the page.

## HTML:

Project title : Bartosz Smorawski

In this file there are tags and attributes that divide the document into:
`<body> <header> <section> <article> <footer>` and on `<form> <nav> <table>`.

- `<body>` - contains the entire content.

- `<header>` - contains the page title, photo and a button to change the background color.

- `<section>` - divides the article into sections. In my case, it's more important than `<article>`.

- `<article>` - divides the sections into two smaller topics.

- `<footer>` - there is a contact form in the footer `(<form>)` and my contact details.

- `<nav>`  - this attribute takes you to a specific section of the page. 

- `<form>` - a simple form to facilitate contact by e-mail.

- `<table>`  - table makes it easy to organize the content.
